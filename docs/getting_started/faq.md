# Frequently Asked Questions


## What is Anterior?

Anterior is an open-source Python backtester that lets you schedule and backtest functions with your data.


## Why should I use Anterior?

Anterior is lightweight, easy to pick up, and compatible with your data and favorite libraries.


## How is Anterior different from orchestratiors?

Anterior schedules and backtests functions, while orchestrators  like [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), 
[Dagster](https://dagster.io/), and [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) automate and manage workflows.


## How is Anterior different from other backtesters?

Anterior is domain-agnostic and meant to be used with your preferred data, tools and libraries.
Conversely, backtesters like [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/), [Backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com/), 
and [Vectorbt](https://vectorbt.dev/) tie you to their ecosystem, and only work for algorithmic trading.
